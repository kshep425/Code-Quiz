## Description
This quiz will assess your coding knowledge of css, html, javascript, and jquery.  We utilize common interview questions to help you prep for interviews and tests.

Answer 5 questions as quickly as possible to enter your name on the leaderboard.  Your score is the time left.  If you answer a question wrong 5 seconds is subtracting from the time left reducing your high score.  You want your score to be as close to 60 seconds as possible!

Don't run out of time! You lose if 60 seconds passes.

In addtion, this tool was created to test my javascript skills, all html elements were created and added using javascript.  The pages were styled using bootstrap.
